FriendFace LoRA Training Project (Stable Diffusion v1.5)

This repository contains the scripts and configuration necessary to train a highly effective LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model on the Stable Diffusion v1.5 base model. The goal is to embed a specific identity, triggered by the keyword friendface person, into the model.

ðŸš€ Quick Start (Training)

These instructions assume you have cloned the kohya_ss repository and placed it directly in your home directory (~/kohya_ss).

1. Prepare Data & Directories

Before training, your image data must be organized in the following strict structure, which will be referenced by the training script:

~/FriendFace_Lora/
â”œâ”€â”€ images_512/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 10_friendface_person/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ friend-image-1.png
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ friend-image-1.txt
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ friend-image-2.png
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ friend-image-2.txt
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ model_512/  (Will be created by the script)
â”œâ”€â”€ log_512/    (Will be created by the script)
â”œâ”€â”€ train_sd15_lora.sh
â””â”€â”€ generate_sd15.py


Image Format: All images must be 512x512 pixels.

Renaming: Rename the directory containing your 512x512 images to 10_friendface_person. The 10 represents the number of repeats (recommended starting point) and friendface person is your trigger keyword.

Captioning: Each image (.png) requires an accompanying text file (.txt) with the same name, containing a detailed description of the image content without mentioning the trigger phrase.

2. Run Training

The included train_sd15_lora.sh script handles environment activation and launches the training process for 1200 steps.

Grant Execution Permissions:

chmod +x train_sd15_lora.sh


Execute the Training:

./train_sd15_lora.sh


Note: The script relies on the accelerate launch utility being configured and the kohya_ss dependencies being installed (including the correct version of PyTorch for your GPU architecture).

âœ¨ Generation (Inference)

Once training is complete, the generate_sd15.py script can be used to test your new LoRA model. It will read the parameters from the script and save the output image to a newly created ./output/ directory.

Ensure Virtual Environment is Active (if not already):

source ~/kohya_ss/venv/bin/activate


Run the Generation Script:

python generate_sd15.py


Key Generation Parameters

The primary trigger is friendface person. Use it at the beginning of your positive prompts to activate the LoRA model.
